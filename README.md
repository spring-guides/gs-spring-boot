# Plane Spotter Application

## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup (Revised - No POM Update)

In this phase, the project structure for the Plane Spotter Application backend has been set up using Java and Spring Boot. This setup includes a complete cleanup of the cloned repository and the establishment of the correct Clean Architecture directory hierarchy under the `com.planespotter` base package.

### Key Steps Performed
- Removed all original "greeting" related code.
- Created the necessary directory structure under `com.planespotter`.
- Added placeholder Java files with package declarations.
- Configured the H2 database for future use.

### Next Steps
In the next phase, the focus will be on implementing the entities and use cases as defined in the directory structure.

No functional code has been implemented yet in this phase.
