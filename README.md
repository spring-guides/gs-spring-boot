# Plane Spotter Application - Backend

## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup (Revised - No POM Update)

This phase focuses on setting up the foundational project structure for the Plane Spotter Application backend using Java and Spring Boot, following Clean Architecture principles.

### Tasks Completed

1. **Repository Cloning and Cleanup**
   - Cloned the repository and removed all existing 'greeting' related code to start with a clean Spring Boot starter project.

2. **Package and Directory Structure**
   - Created the base package `com.planespotter` and relevant sub-packages for domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

3. **Java File Placeholders**
   - Created empty Java files with package declarations as placeholders for future implementation.

4. **H2 Database Configuration**
   - Configured `application.properties` with H2 database settings.

### Notes
- This phase does not include any functional code implementation.
- The project is set up to adhere to Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

## Phase 2: Entities and Use Cases Implementation

### Objective
- Implement the core domain entities and application-specific use cases for the "Plane Spotter Application" backend.

### Next Phase
- The next phase will involve completing the API layer, database persistence, and architectural tests.
